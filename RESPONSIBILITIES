Teodor Janez Podobnik
+ GitLab Repository Maintainter (Structure of the project, cleaning and prepare repository, Documentation Backend & Frontend)
+ Code Formatting (Ada, C, Python)
+ CI/CD Pipeline(Created and Maintained) + Code Coverage
+ Custom Docker image
+ Self-hosted runner (Raspberry Pi Cluster)
+ Unit/Integration Tests for Backend
+ SPARK
+ Development Cycle (Branch Naming, Pull Request etc.)
+ Pair Programming with Teammates
+ Full Backend Development
+ Integration of Frontend and External Controller to Backend
+ Defined protocols for communication between Backend and Frontend and External Controller (Platooning Protocol was done by Ayusch)
+ Integration of the Nodes Graph to Backend and Frontend Software
+ Scripts to run and compile system
+ At the beginning also created a 6-wheel truck that later was not used

+ As a Technical Manager I contributed as:
- Set up the infrastructure of the project 
- Pair Programming session to introduce members to correct usage of infrastructure	 
- Provided Development cycle instructions and made sure we follow them
- Monitor master branch(PR, reverting commits, branch-naming)
- Setup CI/CD and maintain it
+As a Integration Manager
- Defined protocol between Backend and Frontend
- Defined protocol between External Controllers and Backend (not Platooning protocol)
- Extension of interfaces and protocols in response to new requirements (Adjust) 
		+As a Quality Manager
Defined but not implemented safety requirements to the code level
SPARK Testing (Pair Programming session)
Code Reviews and cleaning Merge conflicts

Lubna Yaqoob
+ At the beginning until first milestone i created a complete webots environment, which   later was not considered as final version.
	+ Full frontend development
	+ Defined protocol for communication between frontend and backend 
	+ Defined TCP/IP communication protocol datasets used for webots to 
external controller backend and frontend, 
	+ Testing with SPARK
	+ Full documentation of the project
	+ Pair Programming with Teammates

			As a integration manager
		+ developed communicate through a service call for BE , FE, 
where backend gives feedback on a successful call.
				+ Defined protocol datasets for Backend and External controller
			As a quality manager 
				+SPARK testing (Pair programming session)

Yuke Qian
- Environment:
+ Create the Environment in Webots.
+ Create the Robot proto in Webots.
+ the ideal of using different colors to enter and exit different pickup/drop off location.
+ participate integration testing of the external controller/position algorithm.
+ assist Rene in node graph of our environment for the position algorithm (Rene write position algorithm).
- Webots:
+ unit testing webots controller follow_line with Cheng.
- External controller:
+ Platooning testing and optimization the PID gain (Lu wrote the PID controller for Platoon).
+ fuel consumption function in platoon.
+ safety performance of platoon.
- Documentation
+ README.md file for environment, webots and External controller.
As a Technical Manager:
+ setup Slack group.
+ setup Gitlab project group.
+ try my best to solve the technical problem my teammate meet.
+ participate in integration testing. 

Ayusch Khajuria:

- moderating the external_controlller sub-meeting once a week 

- External Controller:
    Integrating follow_path and webots_server and writing a the Message Handle for proper communication with webots
